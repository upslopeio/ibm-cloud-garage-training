## WSL 2

You must install WSL2 in order to complete this course.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

**NOTE:** Be sure to remember the password you set for your ubuntu user. You'll need this often.

From PowerShell, run

```powershell
wsl --list --verbose
```

Returns the Name of the Linux you installed, thr running state, the WSL version as `2` and the `*` marking default:

```text
  NAME                   STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu-18.04           Running         2
```

If you see something else, may need to set [wsl defaults](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#set-your-distribution-version-to-wsl-1-or-wsl-2) . In this case, to set the particular distro as default, use `wsl --set-default Ubuntu-18.04`.

## Ubuntu Updates
