## ZSH

If you have a modern mac, [zsh should already be your default shell](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651872/apple-macos-catalina-zsh-bash-shell-replacement-features).

1.  Open a new Terminal window (or tab)
1.  Run the following command:

         echo $SHELL

You have ZSH if you see the following output: `/bin/zsh`

> If you see something else, like `/bin/bash`, then you need to install zsh.

## oh-my-zsh

         sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

## Homebrew

1.  Visit https://brew.sh/
1.  Click the "Copy" link and run the command. At the time of this writing, it's:
