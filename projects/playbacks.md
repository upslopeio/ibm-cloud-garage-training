# Playbacks

Start with real customer / production data.

In general:

- Always demo with live URLs
- Encourage participants to try the site for themselves where possible
    - SHow a QR code on a slide if it's a lower environment
- If possible show real live analytics dashboards as opposed to screenshots

When it's fake - people will engage in "bike shedding" - it tends to trend toward micro-management, wasteful activities such as:

- focusing on estimates / velocity / predicting release schedules
- wondering when you'll deliver what they designed upfront
- increasing the animosity on the team

## When people ask why you pair

Focus on things that non-technical users will understand:

- improves code quality (more bugs caught earlier in the cycle)
- reduces risk (people leaving a team, mistakes being pushed to prod)

## When people question time spent on devops

Focus on things that make sense to non-technical users:

- it allows us to push changes safely, which means we can push things more frequently
- more frequent feedback leads to higher quality products
